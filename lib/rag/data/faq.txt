# Tradigoo Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. What is Tradigoo?

Tradigoo is a secure, transparent platform for bulk trade that connects small retailers directly with verified wholesalers, using escrow-based payments and AI-assisted decision support.

---

## 2. How does escrow work?

When a retailer places an order, the payment is held securely on the platform. Funds are released to the wholesaler only after delivery confirmation and completion of the inspection window without dispute.

---

## 3. When does the wholesaler receive payment?

Payment is released after:
- Delivery is confirmed through OTP, and
- The inspection window closes without dispute, or
- A dispute is resolved in favor of the wholesaler.

---

## 4. How can I track my order?

Retailers receive tracking details once the shipment is dispatched. The order status can be monitored directly from the platform dashboard.

---

## 5. What should I do if I receive damaged goods?

You must raise a dispute within the inspection window and record a live unboxing video through the platform. Uploaded or pre-recorded videos are not accepted.

---

## 6. Why is live video recording required for disputes?

Live recording ensures authenticity and prevents manipulation of evidence. It helps the AI system fairly evaluate damage or quantity mismatches.

---

## 7. What happens after I raise a dispute?

The AI system performs an initial review of the live recording. If unresolved, the case is escalated for manual verification before a final decision is made.

---

## 8. Can sellers request direct payment outside the platform?

No. All payments must go through Tradigoo’s escrow system. Off-platform payments are not permitted.

---

## 9. What if delivery fails?

If delivery fails due to incorrect address or unavailability, the shipment may be rescheduled or returned. Escrow funds remain on hold until the issue is resolved.

---

## 10. Are delivery timelines guaranteed?

Delivery timelines depend on courier partners. Tradigoo provides tracking visibility but does not guarantee exact transit duration.

---

## 11. How are sellers verified?

Sellers must complete identity and business verification before listing products on the platform.

---

## 12. Can disputes be raised after the inspection window closes?

No. Disputes must be raised within the defined inspection window after delivery confirmation.

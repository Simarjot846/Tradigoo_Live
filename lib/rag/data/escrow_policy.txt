# Tradigoo Escrow Payment Policy

## 1. What is Escrow?

Tradigoo uses an escrow-based payment system to protect both retailers and wholesalers during bulk transactions. When a retailer places an order, payment is securely held on the Tradigoo platform instead of being immediately transferred to the wholesaler.

This ensures that funds are protected until delivery is successfully completed.

## 2. How the Escrow Process Works

Step 1: The retailer places an order and completes payment through the platform.

Step 2: The payment is securely held in escrow.

Step 3: The wholesaler prepares and ships the goods.

Step 4: The retailer receives the goods and verifies delivery using OTP-based confirmation.

Step 5: The retailer is given an inspection window to check product quality and quantity.

Step 6: If no dispute is raised within the inspection period, the funds are released to the wholesaler.

## 3. Inspection Window

After delivery confirmation, retailers are provided with a defined inspection window to:

- Verify product quality
- Check quantity
- Confirm items match invoice details

If issues are found, a dispute must be raised within the inspection period.

## 4. Dispute Handling in Escrow

If a dispute is raised:

- Funds remain on hold.
- Both parties may be asked to provide evidence such as photos, videos, invoices, or delivery proof.
- Tradigoo reviews submitted information.
- A resolution is provided based on platform policies.

Funds are only released after resolution.

## 5. When Are Funds Released?

Funds are released to the wholesaler when:

- Delivery is confirmed, and
- The inspection window closes without dispute, or
- A dispute is resolved in favor of the wholesaler.

## 6. What Escrow Does Not Cover

Tradigoo’s escrow system:

- Does not guarantee profit or resale success.
- Does not cover disputes raised after the inspection window closes.

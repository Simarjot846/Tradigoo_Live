## 2. Order Confirmation

Once a retailer places an order and completes payment:

- The payment is securely held in escrow.
- The wholesaler receives order details.
- The wholesaler prepares the shipment according to the invoice and platform guidelines.

## 3. Shipment Preparation by Wholesaler

Before dispatch, the wholesaler must:

- Generate a detailed invoice.
- Pack products securely.
- Ensure correct quantity and quality.
- Declare package count and approximate weight.
- Upload shipment details to the platform.

This step ensures accountability before courier pickup.

## 4. Courier Pickup and Logistics Verification

After shipment details are submitted:

- A courier partner picks up the package.
- Basic logistics information such as package count and weight may be verified.
- Tracking details are generated and shared with the retailer.

The shipment becomes traceable from this stage.

## 5. Tracking and In-Transit Updates

Retailers can:

- Track shipment status via tracking ID.
- View estimated delivery timeline.
- Receive notifications for dispatch and delivery updates.

Tradigoo provides visibility but actual transit timelines depend on courier partners.

## 6. Delivery Confirmation (OTP-Based)

Upon delivery:

- The courier requests OTP verification from the retailer.
- The retailer confirms receipt using the OTP provided on the platform.
- OTP confirmation marks successful delivery in the system.

This prevents false delivery confirmations.

## 7. Inspection Window After Delivery

After OTP confirmation:

- The retailer is given a defined inspection window.
- The retailer must verify:
  - Product quality
  - Product quantity
  - Match with invoice details

If any issue is found, a dispute must be raised within the inspection period.

## 8. Failed Delivery Scenarios

Delivery may fail due to:

- Incorrect address
- Retailer unavailable
- Repeated OTP verification failure
- Courier inability to reach destination

In such cases:
- The shipment may be rescheduled or returned.
- Escrow funds remain on hold until resolution.

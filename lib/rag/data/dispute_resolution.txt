# Tradigoo Dispute Resolution Policy

## 1. Overview

Tradigoo follows a structured and evidence-based dispute resolution process to ensure fairness between retailers and wholesalers. Disputes must be raised within the defined inspection window after delivery confirmation.

The platform uses an AI-assisted verification system as the first layer of resolution.

---

## 2. When Can a Dispute Be Raised?

A retailer may raise a dispute if:

- The delivered quantity does not match the invoice.
- The product is damaged.
- The product does not match the ordered specification.
- The shipment contains incorrect items.

Disputes must be initiated within the inspection window.

---

## 3. Live Video Recording Requirement

To maintain authenticity and prevent fraudulent claims:

- Retailers are required to record a LIVE unboxing video through the Tradigoo platform.
- Pre-recorded or uploaded videos are not accepted.
- The recording must clearly show:
  - Package condition before opening
  - Shipping label
  - Unboxing process
  - Product condition
  - Quantity verification

This ensures that evidence is captured in real-time without manipulation.

## 4. AI-Based Initial Review

Once the live video is submitted:

- Tradigoo’s AI system analyzes the recording.
- The AI checks for:
  - Visible damage
  - Quantity mismatch
  - Product inconsistency
  - Tampering signs

Based on analysis, the system generates a preliminary resolution recommendation.

## 5. AI Resolution Outcomes

The AI may:

- Approve full refund
- Approve partial refund
- Recommend replacement
- Reject dispute due to insufficient evidence

If both parties accept the AI decision, escrow funds are processed accordingly.

---

## 6. Manual Verification Escalation

If either party is not satisfied with the AI decision:

- The dispute is escalated to manual review.
- Tradigoo’s verification team reviews:
  - Live video recording
  - Shipment details
  - Invoice data
  - Courier confirmation logs

A final decision is made after manual assessment.

---

## 7. Escrow Handling During Dispute

While a dispute is active:

- Funds remain locked in escrow.
- No payment is released to the wholesaler.
- Refunds or adjustments are processed only after resolution.

---

## 8. Fraud Prevention Measures

To prevent misuse of the system:

- Only platform-recorded live videos are accepted.
- Edited or externally uploaded media is not considered valid evidence.
- Repeated false claims may lead to account restrictions.

---

## 9. Resolution Finality

Once a dispute is resolved:

- Escrow funds are released accordingly.
- The decision is recorded in transaction history.
- Both parties are notified.

The dispute is considered closed after final resolution.
